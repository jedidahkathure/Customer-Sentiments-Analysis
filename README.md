##  **Executive Summary**

This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to analyze thousands of reviews from the **Google Play Store** and **Apple App Store** for Kenya’s leading telecom apps: **Safaricom (M-PESA, MySafaricom)** and **Airtel (Airtel Money, MyAirtel)**.  

We aimed to understand how customers *feel* about these apps — identifying pain points, satisfaction drivers, and opportunities for improvement.  

The end result?  
An intelligent system capable of classifying reviews as **Positive** or **Negative** in real time, helping telcos **track sentiment, detect complaints early, and improve customer experience.**

> “Every review tells a story — we turned those stories into business insights.” 💬

## **Introduction**

In Kenya’s competitive telecom space, where digital financial apps handle millions of transactions daily, *customer experience defines brand loyalty.*  
Safaricom and Airtel users frequently share feedback online — yet, most of these insights remain **unstructured and unread.**

Our solution bridges that gap.  
We built a robust sentiment analysis pipeline capable of analyzing thousands of app reviews, visualizing trends, and predicting customer mood using cutting-edge NLP models.

##  **Business Understanding**

| Focus Area | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Industry Context** | Telecom competition in Kenya is fierce; retaining satisfied users is more profitable than acquiring new ones. |
| **Pain Point** | App users face performance issues, failed logins, delayed SMS/OTP, and transaction errors. |
| **Opportunity** | Sentiment analysis provides early warnings and quantifiable feedback loops for product and customer-care teams. |

---

##  **Stakeholders & Business Value**

### 🔹 **Stakeholders**

- **Customer Experience (CX) Units** – detect and address dissatisfaction early  
- **Marketing Managers** – gauge brand reputation across digital platforms  
- **Executives** – use insights for strategic decisions  
- **Data Science Teams** – maintain and refine the predictive models  

###  **Business Value**
| Value | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Customer Insights** | Quantify satisfaction vs frustration to guide product decisions. |
| **Faster Response** | Detect negative reviews in real time and act before escalation. |
| **Retention & Loyalty** | Prevent churn through early issue resolution. |

---

##  **Goals & Objectives**

1. Collect and preprocess app review data from both platforms.  
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize user sentiment.  
3. Build and compare **binary** (positive vs negative) and **multiclass** (positive, neutral, negative) models.  
4. Evaluate performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
5. Deploy the best model for real-time sentiment prediction via **FastAPI**.  
6. Provide actionable insights and recommendations to telecom stakeholders.

## 📊 **About the Dataset**

| Attribute | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Source** | Google Play Store & Apple App Store |
| **Apps Covered** | Safaricom: M-PESA, MySafaricom  •  Airtel: Airtel Money, MyAirtel |
| **Size** | ~5,000 reviews |
| **Columns** | `date`, `app_name`, `platform`, `rating`, `review`, `sentiment` |
| **Engineered Features** | `clean_text`, `review_length`, `word_count`|

**Languages:** English, Swahili, and Sheng  
**Date Range:** 2023-2025  

---

##  **Data Preparation Steps**

1. **Data Collection** – using App Store and Play Store scraping scripts.  
2. **Text Cleaning** – removal of punctuation, emojis, URLs, and noise.  
3. **Tokenization & Lemmatization** – text normalized for NLP.  
4. **Feature Engineering** – polarity, subjectivity, and length metrics added.  
5. **Class Balancing** – applied SMOTE for minority (negative) class.  
6. **Split Data** – 80% train / 20% test.  

---

##  **Dataset Limitations**

- More data from Google Play than App Store → mild platform bias.  
- Multilingual reviews (Swahili/English mix) → occasional misclassification.  
- Very short reviews like “Good” or “Bad” → limited context.  
- No demographic or regional attributes.  

Despite these constraints, preprocessing ensured **clean, balanced, and high-quality text data.**

##  **Story Behind the Project**

Originally, the team intended to scrape **Twitter data** for public telecom sentiment.  
However, due to **Twitter API restrictions**, we pivoted to analyzing **App Store reviews**, which offered:  
- App-specific, structured, and richer feedback  
- Continuous review availability  
- Real-world relevance to product teams  

This pivot not only improved data quality but also aligned perfectly with **business use cases.**

---

##  **Analysis & Methodology**

|--------|-------------|
| **Data Cleaning** | Removed noise and standardized text. |
| **Exploratory Data Analysis** | Visualized sentiment trends, word frequencies, and app ratings. |
| **Feature Engineering** | Created custom text-based features. |
| **Model Building** | Compared multiple ML algorithms for binary & multiclass problems. |
| **Evaluation** | Used metrics & plots to assess predictive power. |
| **Deployment** | Exposed Logistic Regression (SMOTE) model via FastAPI API. |

### 🔹 Multiclass Classification
Extended classification into **Positive**, **Neutral**, and **Negative** — providing a full picture of customer sentiment.  

### 🔹 Algorithms Compared
- Logistic Regression (baseline & with SMOTE)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Naive Bayes  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  
- DistilBERT Transformer

## ⚙️ **Model Evaluation**

###  Binary Model Metrics
![Binary Metrics](Output/binary_metrics_grid_blues.png)

| Model | Strength |
|--------|-----------|
| **XGBoost** | Strongest overall performance |
| **SVM / Decision Tree** | Better for complaint detection |
| **Naive Bayes** | Fastest training time |
| **Logistic Regression (SMOTE)** | Balanced, interpretable, and chosen for deployment ✅ |

---

### 📉 Confusion Matrices
![Confusion Matrices](Output/CM_grid_all_models_binary_blues.png)
*Dark squares = correct predictions. All models classify positives well, negatives remain challenging.*

---

###  SMOTE vs BERT
![SMOTE vs BERT](Output/binary_metrics_grid_SMOTE_vs_BERT.png)

**DistilBERT** achieved >92% accuracy — strongest overall.  
However, **Logistic Regression (SMOTE)** was selected for production:  
lightweight, explainable, and ideal for real-time sentiment tracking.

---

##  **ROC Curves — Binary Classification (Positive vs Negative)**

![ROC Curves - Binary](Output/ROC_all_models_binary_blues.png)

The **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve** visualizes how well each model distinguishes between **positive** and **negative** sentiments.

###  **Interpretation**
- Each line represents a model’s trade-off between **True Positive Rate (Recall)** and **False Positive Rate**.
- The **closer the curve hugs the top-left corner**, the stronger the model’s ability to correctly identify sentiment.
- The **Area Under the Curve (AUC)** quantifies this — higher AUC means better discrimination between positive and negative reviews.
